This project is a CRUD app that I created using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP. The purpose of this project was to create an app that would allow for
the user to search through a contact book. On the index page, a list is displayed of all the records, displaying user information such as the name
of the contact, their corresponding image, their phone number, their email address, and their user ID. Next to each entry, there is a button to view,
edit, or delete each entry in the table, and it will take you to each corresponding page, depending on which one you click.

All of the CRUD functionality in this project is done using the PHP Programming Language, and for some tasks, like the search bar, and the sort button
on the homepage that lets you sort through entries alphabetically, I ended up using jQuery.

Bootstrap was used for the design of all the pages.

This project can be ran through any web server manager (ie. MAMP, XAMPP, LAMP), no installation of a framework is required to test this project.
